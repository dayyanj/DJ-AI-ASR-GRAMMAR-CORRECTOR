# ASR Grammar Corrector

A post-ASR correction model trained on 90 million noisy / clean pairs, designed to fix typical speech recognition errors in (near) real-time. It helps clean up transcriptions from ASR systems like Whisper, Nemo etc, improving readability and grammatical correctness with minimal latency.

Designed to:
Improve readability and professionalism in transcripts
Make ASR outputs usable for customer service, legal, and healthcare
Helping non-native speakers interpret ASR more easily
Supports real-time captioning and assistive technologies

## Features

- Fixes common ASR issues:
  - Homophones (e.g., ‚Äútheir‚Äù vs ‚Äúthere‚Äù)
  - Subject-verb agreement
  - Verb tense errors
  - Missing auxiliaries and articles
  - Contractions and prepositions
  - Pronoun misuse
  - Repeated or corrupted words

- Fast inference (<50ms on GPU)
- Easy to plug into real-time ASR pipelines
- HuggingFace-compatible model loading

# DJ-AI ASR Grammar Corrector

A lightweight grammar correction model fine-tuned from `t5-small` and `t5-base`, specifically designed to correct common errors in **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** outputs ‚Äî including homophones, verb tense issues, contractions, duplicated words, and more. Optimized for **fast inference** in (near) real-time ASR pipelines.

## Model Details

- **Small model**: [`t5-small`](https://huggingface.co/t5-small)
- **Base model**: [`t5-base`](https://huggingface.co/t5-base)
- **Fine-tuned on**: 90 million synthetic (noisy ‚Üí clean) sentence pairs
- **Training objective**: Correct ASR-style transcription errors into clean, grammatical English
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers + PyTorch

1. Accuracy is a measure of how well the model performs across the full sentence. That is, a prediction is only counted as "correct" if the entire corrected sentence exactly matches the reference sentence. So if the model corrects 1 out of 2 errors, but the final output does not exactly match the expected sentence, it's counted as a fail.
2. Token Accuracy is a measure of how well the model performs at the token level.
$$\text{Token Accuracy (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Matched Tokens}}{\text{Total Reference Tokens}} \right) \times 100$$

## Corrects Common ASR Errors:

- Homophone mistakes (`their` ‚Üí `they're`)
- Subject-verb disagreement (`he go` ‚Üí `he goes`)
- Verb tense corruption (`i seen` ‚Üí `i saw`)
- Missing auxiliaries (`you going` ‚Üí `are you going`)
- Contraction normalization (`she is not` ‚Üí `she isn't`)
- Repeated words (`i i want` ‚Üí `i want`)
- Misused articles/prepositions/pronouns

## Example

**Input (noisy ASR)**:

## Pretrained Models
Models have been trained on DJ-AI Custom Dataset which includes over 90 million real and synthetic ASR errors and corrected texts pairs. The models are based on T5 pretrained models.
